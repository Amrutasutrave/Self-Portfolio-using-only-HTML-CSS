	<h1><center>The data analytics process typically involves several key steps:</center></h1>

	<div class="point1">
		<ol>
			<li><span>Data Collection:</span> The first step is gathering relevant data from various sources, which can include databases, spreadsheets, sensors, and even social media. The data may be structured (organized in a specific format) or unstructured (not organized in a predefined manner).</li><br>

			<li><span>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</span> Raw data is often imperfect, containing errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. Data analysts clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is accurate and ready for analysis. This can involve data imputation, outlier detection, and data transformation.</li><br>

			<li><span>Data Analysis:</span> Analysts use statistical techniques, data visualization tools, and sometimes machine learning algorithms to explore the data and uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. This phase helps in understanding the data and its potential insights.</li><br>

			<li><span>Data Interpretation and Reporting: </span>Once meaningful insights are derived, data analysts interpret the results in the context of the problem or question being addressed. They create reports, dashboards, or presentations to communicate these insights to stakeholders.</li><br>
